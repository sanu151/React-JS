      <p>
        Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It
        involves a combination of skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        to create interactive and dynamic web experiences. Web developers work
        on both the front-end (what users see) and back-end (server-side logic)
        of websites. They craft user interfaces, design databases, and write
        code to ensure seamless functionality.
