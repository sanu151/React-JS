    title: "React",
    body: "React is a Versatile JavaScript Library for Building User Interfaces React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It employs a component-based architecture, breaking down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components. This modular approach makes development and maintenance efficient. React's virtual DOM efficiently updates the actual DOM, optimizing performance. Key features of React include JSX (JavaScript XML) for writing HTML-like structures within JavaScript, state management with the `useState` hook, and side effect handling with the `useEffect` hook. These tools, combined with React Router for navigation and other libraries like Redux for state management, enable developers to create dynamic, interactive, and scalable web applications.",
